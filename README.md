## Automatic Generation of Reading Program V1.1
Automatic Generation of Reading Program(AGRP) is a kind of software which can build code and read data with guidance of DFML document. Following two examples will show how to use AGRP to generate read code and data reading of binary file and text file.

### Case study on binary files
As shown in Fig 13, the DFML document has been loaded and shown as a DFML
tree. The C# language has been used to generate codes. Moreover, all data items included
in the shapefile are selected to be read. It can be easily seen that the data have been output
in the user interface of the software. The corresponding values of the properties of point
layer of 13 middle schools of Nanjing city, China, in 2008, are output. In regard to random
reading, the codes for reading data are generated based on the selected nodes in the â€œDFML
